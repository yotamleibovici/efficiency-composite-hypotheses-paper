	title = {Bioequivalence trials, intersection-union tests and equivalence confidence sets},
	volume = {11},
	abstract = {The bioequivalence problem is of practical importance because the approval of most generic drugs in the United States and the European Community (EC) requires the establishment of bioequivalence between the brand-name drug and the proposed generic version. The problem is theoretically interesting because it has been recognized as one for which the desired inference, instead of the usual significant difference, is practical equivalence. The concept of intersection-union tests will be shown to clarify, simplify and unify bioequivalence testing. A test more powerful than the one currently specified by the FDA and EC guidelines will be derived. The claim that the bioequivalence problem defined in terms of the ratio of parameters is more difficult than the problem defined in terms of the difference of parameters will be refuted. The misconception that size-αα{\textbackslash}alpha bioequivalence tests generally correspond to 100(1−2α)100(1−2α)100(1 - 2 {\textbackslash}alpha)\% confidence sets will be shown to lead to incorrect statistical practices, and should be abandoned. Techniques for constructing 100(1−α)100(1−α)100(1 - {\textbackslash}alpha)\% confidence sets that correspond to size-αα{\textbackslash}alpha bioequivalence tests will be described. Finally, multiparameter bioequivalence problems will be discussed.},

@article{robins_identifiability_1992,
	title = {Identifiability and exchangeability for direct and indirect effects},
	volume = {3},
	abstract = {We consider the problem of separating the direct effects of an exposure from effects relayed through an intermediate variable (indirect effects). We show that adjustment for the intermediate variable, which is the most common method of estimating direct effects, can be biased. We also show that even in a randomized crossover trial of exposure, direct and indirect effects cannot be separated without special assumptions; in other words, direct and indirect effects are not separately identifiable when only exposure is randomized. If the exposure and intermediate never interact to cause disease and if intermediate effects can be controlled, that is, blocked by a suitable intervention, then a trial randomizing both exposure and the intervention can separate direct from indirect effects. Nonetheless, the estimation must be carried out using the G-computation algorithm. Conventional adjustment methods remain biased. When exposure and the intermediate interact to cause disease, direct and indirect effects will not be separable even in a trial in which both the exposure and the intervention blocking intermediate effects are randomly assigned. Nonetheless, in such a trial, one can still estimate the fraction of exposure-induced disease that could be prevented by control of the intermediate. Even in the absence of an intervention blocking the intermediate effect, the fraction of exposure-induced disease that could be prevented by control of the intermediate can be estimated with the G-computation algorithm if data are obtained on additional confounding variables.},

@article{mcclintick_effects_2006,
	title = {Effects of filtering by {Present} call on analysis of microarray experiments},
	volume = {7},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Affymetrix GeneChips are widely used for expression profiling of tens of thousands of genes. The large number of comparisons can lead to false positives. Various methods have been used to reduce false positives, but they have rarely been compared or quantitatively evaluated. Here we describe and evaluate a simple method that uses the detection (Present/Absent) call generated by the Affymetrix microarray suite version 5 software (MAS5) to remove data that is not reliably detected before further analysis, and compare this with filtering by expression level. We explore the effects of various thresholds for removing data in experiments of different size (from 3 to 10 arrays per treatment), as well as their relative power to detect significant differences in expression.
RESULTS: Our approach sets a threshold for the fraction of arrays called Present in at least one treatment group. This method removes a large percentage of probe sets called Absent before carrying out the comparisons, while retaining most of the probe sets called Present. It preferentially retains the more significant probe sets (p {\textless} or = 0.001) and those probe sets that are turned on or off, and improves the false discovery rate. Permutations to estimate false positives indicate that probe sets removed by the filter contribute a disproportionate number of false positives. Filtering by fraction Present is effective when applied to data generated either by the MAS5 algorithm or by other probe-level algorithms, for example RMA (robust multichip average). Experiment size greatly affects the ability to reproducibly detect significant differences, and also impacts the effect of filtering; smaller experiments (3-5 samples per treatment group) benefit from more restrictive filtering ({\textgreater} or =50\% Present).
CONCLUSION: Use of a threshold fraction of Present detection calls (derived by MAS5) provided a simple method that effectively eliminated from analysis probe sets that are unlikely to be reliable while preserving the most significant probe sets and those turned on or off; it thereby increased the ratio of true positives to false positives.},
